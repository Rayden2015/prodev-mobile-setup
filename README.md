# Mobile Development Setup - Expo Project

## Project Overview
This repository contains an Expo mobile development setup created with `create-expo-app` using the Expo Router template.

## Scaffolding Steps

### 1. Project Creation
Created the Expo project using the command:
```bash
npx create-expo-app prodev-mobile-setup
```

Selected configuration:
- **Template**: Blank (TypeScript)
- **Router**: Expo Router (file-based routing)
- **Features**: React Native, TypeScript, Expo Router

### 2. Project Structure
The scaffolded project includes:
- `app/` - Directory for file-based routing with Expo Router
- `assets/` - Images and static assets
- `components/` - Reusable React components
- `hooks/` - Custom React hooks
- `constants/` - App constants (theme, configs)
- Configuration files: `app.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `eslint.config.js`, `package.json`

### 3. Key Dependencies Installed
- **Expo SDK**: ~54.0.20
- **React**: 19.1.0
- **React Native**: 0.81.5
- **Expo Router**: ~6.0.13 (file-based routing)
- **React Navigation**: For navigation primitives
- **Expo Image**: Optimized image component
- **TypeScript**: ~5.9.2 for type safety

### 4. Development Commands
- `npm start` - Start Expo development server
- `npm run ios` - Start on iOS simulator
- `npm run android` - Start on Android emulator
- `npm run web` - Start web version
- `npm run reset-project` - Reset to blank app (see observations below)

## Reset-Project Command Observations

### What It Does
The `reset-project` command (`npm run reset-project`) is designed to help you start fresh by:
1. Moving existing starter code to `/app-example` directory
2. Creating a new minimal `/app` directory
3. Setting up basic `index.tsx` and `_layout.tsx` files

### Issues Encountered
**Issue 1: Script Path Reference Broken**
After running the reset command, the `reset-project.js` script gets moved to `app-example/scripts/` directory. However, the `package.json` still references it at the original location:
```json
"reset-project": "node ./scripts/reset-project.js"
```
This causes the command to fail on subsequent runs because the script is no longer at that path.

**Solution**: The reset script warns that it can be removed after first use:
```javascript
// You can remove the `reset-project` script from package.json and safely delete this file after running it.
```

**Issue 2: Non-Interactive Execution**
The script requires user input (Y/n) to determine whether to move files to `app-example` or delete them. In non-interactive environments or when automating, this might cause issues.

### Current State
- ✅ Initial scaffolding completed successfully
- ✅ Expo setup working on iPhone (seamless installation, no issues)
- ✅ Reset command executed (starter code moved to `app-example/`)
- ⚠️ Script path in package.json needs updating if reset command is to be used again

## Development Experience

Installing Expo on iPhone was seamless with no issues encountered. The development workflow using Expo Go app provides:
- Hot reload during development
- Real-time updates on device
- Easy testing without building native binaries
- Cross-platform development (iOS, Android, Web)

## Next Steps
1. Continue development in the `app/` directory
2. Reference starter examples in `app-example/` if needed
3. Can safely delete `app-example/` directory when no longer needed
4. Update or remove the `reset-project` script from package.json if re-running is required
